# Karate Training Journal

A lightweight training journal
**training, rest, and reflection** in one place.

- explicit rest days
- daily reflection
- simple weekly statistics

It is designed to support *thinking about training*.

## What this app is for

- Logging Karate, strength, running, rowing, cardio, and rest
- Recording perceived energy and session emphasis
- Reviewing what happened on a specific day (“Reflection”)
